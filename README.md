## 🤖 Introduction

In today's video we will discuss about websocket APIs web circuit apis support two-way communication that is both the users and the back-end can send messages back and forth once connected so it's used in real-time applications like charts broadcast messages or real-time dashboards you can create websocket apis in aws using aws api gateway service.

## 	📝 Hands-on Overview

The sample use case that we are going to see today is a real-time chat application with few components:

* First is obviously the API gateway service itself which is used to set up the application 
* And will be connected to three different lambdas to perform three different actions to establish connection to send messages  
* Finally to disconnect then we have a dynamodb table which keeps track of all the current connections.

## 🚨 AWS Services Used

* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon DynamoDB



## 📐 Architecture Design

##  Step 1️⃣ : Create a DynamoDB Table


Navigate to the console, seach "DynamoDB", then click "Create Table"

*  We are going to name it `websocket-connections` this is going to be used to store all the active connections

* For the "Partition Key" we can name it `connectionId` and these connection IDs are generated values which are generated by the api gateway

## Step 2️⃣ : Create a Lambda Function


We are going to create 3 Lambda Functions

👉 The first one is going to be named `websockt-connect` this is going to be invoked whenever there is a new connection to our api gateway, i'm going to use `python 3.9` that's the latest version supported by lambda.
