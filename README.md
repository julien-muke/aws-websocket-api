## 	📝 Hands-on Overview

The sample use case that we are going to see today is a real-time char application there are few components:

* First is obviously the API gateway service itself which is used to set up the application 
* And will be connected to three different lambdas to perform three different actions to establish connection to send messages  
* Finally to disconnect then we have a dynamodb table which keeps track of all the current connections.
