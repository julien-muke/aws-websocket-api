## ü§ñ Introduction

In today's video we will discuss about websocket APIs web circuit apis support two-way communication that is both the users and the back-end can send messages back and forth once connected so it's used in real-time applications like charts broadcast messages or real-time dashboards you can create websocket apis in aws using aws api gateway service.

## 	üìù Hands-on Overview

The sample use case that we are going to see today is a real-time chat application with few components:

* First is obviously the API gateway service itself which is used to set up the application 
* And will be connected to three different lambdas to perform three different actions to establish connection to send messages  
* Finally to disconnect then we have a dynamodb table which keeps track of all the current connections.

## üö® AWS Services Used

* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon DynamoDB



## üìê Architecture Design

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1: Create a DynamoDB Table


Navigate to the console, seach "DynamoDB", then click "Create Table"

*  We are going to name it `websocket-connections` this is going to be used to store all the active connections

* For the "Partition Key" we can name it `connectionId` and these connection IDs are generated values which are generated by the api gateway
